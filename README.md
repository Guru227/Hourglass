# Hourglass
~ A Desktop Timer Application with specific focus on reminding the user about breaks.

## Current Features
A single timer, called an 'hourglass', that reminds you to take breaks every 30 minutes by popping up a window which partially renders your screen useless.
The timer creates an xml configuration file called 'defaultConfig' which can be edited to show different popup messages and change timer durations. 

## Yet to be implemented
Multiple configurable hourglasses with custom messages.\
GUI interface for configuring the hourglasses.\
Unit Tests.\
Documentation.
